📡 DX Cluster Dashboard – v5.2

META ANALYSIS — Analysis Page

The META ANALYSIS panel is not a real-time widget.
It is a delayed, log-based analysis tool designed to provide a macro-level view of radio activity.

It is based on the application log (radio_spot_watcher.log) and answers a simple question:

What actually happened over time, beyond the real-time spot flow?

What META ANALYSIS does

Parses the application log

Extracts valid DX spots

Cleans duplicates and noise

Aggregates data over a defined time range

Produces structured summary files used by the UI

How it works

META ANALYSIS runs in manual daily mode:

No automatic cron execution

One analysis run per 24 hours

Triggered manually via the RUN button

This design choice is intentional:
it favors reliable, calm analysis over continuous recalculation.

What it is not

It does not predict propagation

It does not replace real-time monitoring

It does not provide automatic recommendations

META ANALYSIS documents recent past activity to support better understanding and decision-making.



Neural Analysis Edition

A real-time web dashboard for radio amateurs, focused on decision-making, DX monitoring, and analysis of observed on-air activity, connected to a DX Cluster via Telnet.

Version 5.1 marks a clear shift in philosophy:

👉 we no longer look at spots — we interpret real radio activity.

🚀 What’s new in v5.0?
🗺️ New map.html page — Advanced DX activity reading
🗺️ Fixed a bug where the "watchlist" call displayed in yellow in the live spot panel.
The Map page is no longer a simple plotting of points.
It now provides three complementary analysis modes, selectable by the operator.
🔹 Points mode (reference)

Classic spot display:

    One point = one real spot

    Color = band

    Size = SPD score

    Popup with callsign, mode, distance, score

📌 Use case: precise, spot-by-spot inspection.

🔥 Mode A — Band-specific Heatmap (observed activity)

The Heatmap shows where radio activity has actually been observed recently on a single band.

Exact principle:

Each recent spot becomes a source of intensity

Intensity is proportional to the SPD score

Colored areas indicate concentrated, real activity

⚠️ Important:

The heatmap is intentionally limited to one band

It does not represent ionospheric propagation

It does not draw radio paths

Heatmap = observed activity, not prediction.

📌 Recommended usage:

Analyzing one specific band (e.g. 20m)

Quickly identifying where activity is concentrated

Short time windows (5–15 min) = ongoing openings

🟠 Mode C — Activity Circles (low-density reading)

The Circles mode is designed for realistic operating conditions:

Few spots

CW / SSB traffic

Sparse DX activity

Principle:

Each spot draws a semi-transparent circular area

Radius based on a simple readability heuristic (distance-aware)

Color = band

This mode fills the map visually without lying about density.

📌 Recommended usage:

When the heatmap is too weak to be meaningful

To visualize probable active zones

A true “radio-operator” reading, not statistical smoothing

🧠 Integrated assisted reading

The left column dynamically explains:

what the current mode represents

when it should be used

when it should not

Goal: no ambiguity, no misinterpretation.

✍️ Integrated Manual Spot (from the Dashboard)

The Map page now embeds the “Manual Spot” panel:

Direct DX command injection into the cluster

Auto-fill from the last clicked map spot

Clear status feedback (OK / error / cluster not connected)

👉 Full functional continuity with the main dashboard.

🧠 v5.0 philosophy

Version 5.0 does not attempt to predict propagation.
It focuses strictly on what is observable, measurable, and immediately actionable:

Real on-air activity

Traffic density

Active DX areas

Prioritization via the SPD score

The map becomes an analysis tool, not a decorative graphic.
