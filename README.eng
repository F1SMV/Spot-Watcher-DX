# 📡 Radio Spot Watcher DX — v6.1

**DX Cluster Dashboard & Advanced Radio Analysis Engine**

A local web application for DX monitoring and radio analysis designed for demanding Ham Radio operators.
Built to **observe**, **understand**, and **gain perspective** — not just to add visual noise.

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Radio Spot Watcher DX** is a local web app that:

- Connects to one or multiple **DX Clusters (Telnet)**
- Displays **real-time spots** (HF / VHF / UHF)
- Integrates **solar indices** (SFI, A, Kp…)
- Maintains an **actionable memory** of activity
- Offers **multiple levels of data reading**, from live feeds to strategic analysis

> The goal is not to see a lot,
> but to **see right**.

---

## 🖥️ Main Pages

### 1️⃣ **Index** Page — Real-time & Operator Monitoring

Immediate observation page.

It displays:
- Live spot stream
- Active bands
- Wanted DX stations (*watchlist*)
- Solar indices
- Activity **surge** signals

👉 **Goal: Know what is happening right now.**

---

### 📡 **WATCHLIST · Tracking** Block

A feature introduced to answer a simple need:

> *"I wasn't in front of the screen: what did I miss?"*

- Based on your watchlist
- Utilizes in-memory history
- Displays the latest spots by callsign

**Philosophy:**
- ❌ Not a raw log
- ❌ Not a massive data dump
- ✅ A catch-up tool
- ✅ Designed for the human operator

---

### 2️⃣ **Map** Page — Observation Map (Micro-reading)

Classic map of **individual spots**:

- Each point = **one station**
- Immediate geographical representation
- Instantaneous vision

👉 **Goal: See where the action is.**

The **Map** page is an **execution tool**.

---

### 3️⃣ **Analysis** Page — Delayed META-ANALYSIS

A deliberately **non-real-time** tool based on the application log analysis.

👉 **A perspective tool**, not a gadget.

---

### 4️⃣ **World** Page — Forecast & Anomalies (New in v6)

The **World** page is **fundamentally different** from the Map page.

| Page | Nature | Question |
|---|---|---|
| Map | Raw Observation | Who is active right now? |
| World | Interpreted Analysis | Where is propagation abnormally favorable? |

- Displays **zones**, not individual stations
- Spatio-temporal clustering
- Noise filtering
- Controlled refresh rates

👉 **World decides, Map executes.**

---

### 5️⃣ **Briefing** Page — Essential DX updates every 12h

A newly introduced summary page that updates every 12 hours, capturing the most critical DX information and upcoming events.
