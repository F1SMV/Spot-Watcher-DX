📡 Radio Spot Watcher DX — v5.6

DX Cluster Dashboard & Advanced Radio Analysis Engine

A local web application for DX monitoring and radio propagation analysis, designed for serious radio amateurs.
Built to observe, understand, and step back — not to generate visual noise.
🧭 Overview

Radio Spot Watcher DX is a local web application that:

    connects to one or more DX Clusters (Telnet)

    displays real-time spots (HF / VHF / UHF)

    integrates solar indices (SFI, A, Kp…)

    keeps a usable activity memory

    provides several analysis layers, from live monitoring to strategic review

    The goal is not to see more, but to see better
🖥️ Main Pages
1️⃣ Index Page — Real-time monitoring & operator tracking

This is the immediate observation page.

It displays:

    live DX spots

    active bands

    wanted / rare DX

    solar indices

    activity surge indicators

👉 Goal: know what is happening right now.

📡 Watchlist Tracking Panel (new in v5.6)

The WATCHLIST · TRACKING panel answers a very concrete operator need:

    “I wasn’t in front of the screen — what did I miss on my watched calls?”

How it works

    based on the watchlist

    uses an in-memory spot history

    displays the last 5 or 10 spots per callsign

Features

    dynamic callsign filter (e.g. 9, VK, /P)

    automatic refresh

    clear display:

        UTC time

        band

        mode

        frequency

Philosophy

    ❌ not a raw log

    ❌ not a massive dump

    ✅ a catch-up activity tool

    ✅ designed for the human operator

When the filter is empty, the panel intentionally remains neutral.

2️⃣ Map Page — Observation map

Classic spot map:

    geographic visualization

    immediate activity overview

    natural complement to the live spot list

👉 Goal: see where it’s happening.
3️⃣ Analysis Page — META analysis (delayed)

The META ANALYSIS page is deliberately not real-time.

It is based on the application log file:

radio_spot_watcher.log

Principle

A dedicated script:

    parses the log

    removes duplicates and noise

    aggregates data over a time period

    generates structured files (data/meta/*.json)

These datasets are then displayed in the Analysis page.

What META Analysis does

    macro-level activity reading

    DX ranking over time

    validation (or invalidation) of operator intuition

What it does NOT do

    ❌ no prediction

    ❌ no live alerting

    ❌ no blind automation

👉 This is a strategic review tool, not a monitoring gadget.
4️⃣ World Page — Forecast & Anomalies (major new feature)

The World Forecast Map is an advanced analysis tool, clearly separated from the classic map.
Core principle

Compare:

    what is expected (propagation model)

    what is observed (real spots)

👉 to display only what deviates from the model.
What the World page shows

    🌍 a worldwide map

    🔥 red heatmap zones representing anomalous clusters

    📍 callsigns displayed directly on the map

    🧠 immediate understanding of unusual propagation

Definition of an anomaly

A cluster is considered anomalous based on:

    band

    UTC time

    distance

    mode (FT8 weighted differently)

    temporal coherence

    solar indices

A Surprise Score is computed.
Only clusters exceeding a threshold are displayed.
World page philosophy

    ❌ no magic

    ❌ no blind prediction

    ❌ no visual noise

    ✅ what you see deserves your attention

The World page is a strategic reading tool, not a live monitor

⚙️ Technical architecture

    Backend: Python / Flask

    Frontend: HTML / CSS / JavaScript (local)

    Cluster: DX Cluster (Telnet)

    Logs: single application log file

    Analysis: dedicated Python scripts

    Storage: memory + local JSON files

No cloud dependency.
Designed for Raspberry Pi or local machines.
🎨 CSS organization

The project deliberately separates:

    base.css → themes, colors, global variables

    inline CSS per page → critical layout and readability

⚠️ Some inline styles override the theme.
This is an intentional choice for operational readability.
🔐 Security & philosophy

    local / LAN application

    no public exposure by default

    no telemetry

    no critical external dependency

The operator remains fully in control of the data.
