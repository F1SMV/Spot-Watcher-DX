# 📡 Radio Spot Watcher DX — v6.0

**DX Cluster Dashboard & Advanced Radio Analysis Engine**

Local web application for DX cluster monitoring and advanced radio analysis, designed for demanding radio amateurs.  
Built to **observe**, **understand**, and **step back** — not to generate visual noise.

---

## 🧭 General Overview

**Radio Spot Watcher DX** is a local web application that:

- connects to one or more **DX Clusters (Telnet)**
- displays **real-time spots** (HF / VHF / UHF)
- integrates **solar indices** (SFI, A, Kp…)
- maintains an **exploitable activity memory**
- offers **multiple reading levels**, from live monitoring to strategic analysis

> The goal is not to see more,  
> but to **see more accurately**.

## 🖥️ Main Pages

### 1️⃣ **Index Page** — Real-time & Operator View

Immediate observation page.

It displays:
- live spot stream
- active bands
- wanted DX
- solar indices
- activity surge indicators

👉 **Goal: understand what is happening right now.**

---

### 📡 **WATCHLIST · Tracking Panel**

Feature designed to answer a simple question:

> *“I wasn’t in front of the screen — what did I miss?”*

- based on the watchlist
- uses an in-memory spot history
- shows the latest spots per callsign

Philosophy:
- ❌ not a raw log  
- ❌ not a massive dump  
- ✅ a recovery tool  
- ✅ designed for the human operator  

---

### 2️⃣ **Map Page** — Observation Map (Micro View)

Classic map showing **individual spots**:

- one point = one station
- immediate geographic visualization
- real-time perception

👉 **Goal: see where activity is occurring.**

The **Map** page is an **execution tool**.

---

### 3️⃣ **Analysis Page** — Deferred META ANALYSIS

A deliberately **non-real-time** analysis tool based on the application log.

👉 **A tool for perspective**, not a gadget.

---

### 4️⃣ **World Page** — Forecast & Anomalies (Major v6 Feature)

The **World** page is **fundamentally different** from the Map page.

| Page | Nature | Question |
|---|---|---|
| Map | Raw observation | Who is active right now? |
| World | Interpreted analysis | Where is propagation abnormally favorable? |

- displays **zones**, not stations
- spatio-temporal clustering
- noise filtering
- controlled auto-refresh

👉 **World decides, Map executes.**
