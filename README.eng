📡 DX Cluster Dashboard – v4.6 (Neural AI Edition)

A next-generation real-time web dashboard for radio amateurs, powered by a statistical analysis engine and connected to a DX Cluster via Telnet.

Designed for proactive DX monitoring, advanced geographical visualization, and propagation optimization.

🚀 What's New in v4.6?

This version introduces the "Neural AI" label, adding a layer of intelligence and analysis to raw cluster data:

🧠 SPD (Spot Priority/Difficulty) Scoring Engine

    Assigns a score from 0 to 100 for each spot based on prefix rarity, mode (CW bonus), distance, and comments (Split, Up, DX).

Immediately identifies "Wanted" stations with a Score > 70.

🗺️ AI Path Optimizer & Grayline

    Path Visualization: Calculates and displays the optimal path vs. Long Path for each spot.

Propagation Analysis: Recommendations based on the Grayline to avoid ionospheric absorption.

📊 24h DXCC Statistics & Rarity

    New analytical dashboard including:

        Number of unique DXCC entities contacted/seen in 24 hours.

Global Rarity Rate (%).

Dynamic list of "Long Distance" calls (> 10,000 km).

🌠 Meteor Scatter (MS) Monitoring

    Integration of meteor shower calendars (Perseids, Leonids, etc.).

Automatic detection of MSK144 activity on 2m with dedicated "Surge" alerts.

🛠️ Core Features
🔗 Cluster Connectivity

    Persistent Telnet connection to multiple sources (dxfun.com, cluster.dx.de, etc.) with auto-reconnection.

Send manual spots directly from the interface.

☀️ NOAA Solar Data

    Real-time retrieval of SFI, A, and K indices from NOAA servers.

Solar data export via API in XML and JSON formats.

🗣️ Voice Synthesis & Alerts

    Multilingual voice announcements (FR, EN, ES, HE) for new spots.

Personalized Watchlist management with visual and audio notifications.

📊 Modular Interface

    Drag & Drop dashboard panels.

12-hour activity histograms by band.

🧠 Technical Architecture

    Backend: Python 3.x / Flask.

Processing: Multithreading (Dedicated workers for Telnet, Solar, RSS, and Statistics).

Frontend: HTML5 / Vanilla JavaScript / Leaflet (Mapping).

Data: Geolocation via cty.dat (auto-updated) and watchlist.json.

New API Endpoints v4.6:

    /dxcc_stats_24h.json: Daily analytical data.

/ai_path_data.json: Coordinates for the path optimizer.

/api/solar.xml: XML feed of solar data for third-party integration.
